D1 : count how many times 'l' appears in "hello world":

im just iterating the string and checking if each letter is equal to 'l', if yes then im incrementing the counter


#D2 : find the smallest value in an array of 8 integers:

first im taking inputs for the array, then im setting the min variable value as the first element of the array in the beggining then i itterate every element in the array and if the element is lesser than the current min variable value then the lesser element will be the new value for min variable

#D3 : manually find the 2nd largest number in an array

first im taking inputs for the array, then im setting the max variable value as the first element of the array in the begginign and then i set second highest number variable whoich i took as 'sec' as the first element too, then i itterate every element in the array and if the element is greater than max variable value then sec variable takes max varaible value and  tht greater element value will be the new value for max variable, so the sec variable will have the second highest number as its value
